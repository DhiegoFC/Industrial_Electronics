## üìò About the Course
This repository contains the material for the **Industrial Electronics laboratory module on microcontrollers** offered at the Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences (Dalmine Campus).  

The module focuses on the **practical use of microcontrollers (Arduino platform)** to demonstrate how **sensors, transducers, amplifiers, and actuators** are integrated into control systems for industrial processes.  

- **Total duration:** 16 hours  
- **Format:** 8 sessions of 2 hours (or 6 sessions of ~3 hours), all in the laboratory  
- **Language:** English  
- **Lab resources:** 10 Arduino kits available (2 students per kit, class size usually ~20 students)  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the number of students exceeds the availability of kits, laboratory sessions may be duplicated to ensure all participants have access to the hardware.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the structure and role of **microcontrollers** in industrial control systems.  
- Identify and classify different types of **transducers** (position, velocity, acceleration, temperature, deformation, etc.).  
- Use **signal conditioning circuits** (amplifiers, bridges, filters) to prepare sensor signals for microcontrollers.  
- Implement control of **actuators** (LEDs, buzzers, DC motors, stepper motors, servo systems).  
- Apply concepts of **feedback and closed-loop control** using Arduino-based prototypes.  
- Relate theoretical concepts of **Industrial Electronics** with practical experiments.
